# 0.1.2 / 

# 0.1.1 / 2013-09-02

- KDC returns an `ExitStatus: 34` if it is used to compile an application with
  missing source definitions. This will actually be a pretty common error due
  to the fact that users will try and compile existing apps without the source.

# 0.1.0 / 2013-09-01

- First release. Basic feature set including manual & auto compile, refreshing,
  and app embedding.
